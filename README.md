## Goal

Optimizing the conversion rate is very important for business. It helps the business to grow their customer base, reduces the cost of advertising cacampaigns and as a result, generates more revenue. 

This project aims to predict the conversion rate by building a model, find out what kind of features have an impact on the conversion rate,and which segments perform good or bad. Based on the findings, I will provide insights for the marketing team. 

The data contains the demographic charateristics (eg: sex,age) and the browsing behaviours of the users. A user was considered "Converted" if end up buying something within a session, and vice versa.
